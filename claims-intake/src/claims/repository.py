"""Persistence for recorded notifications.

An in-memory store is sufficient for Week 1 and is deliberate rather than a
shortcut. The rules do not know where a notification is stored, so replacing this
with a database in a later week is a change to one module.

The duplicate check that `WI-0151` describes is a query against what has been
recorded, which is why it belongs here rather than in the rule table.

Day 2 assignment. Implement against `docs/api-contract.md` section 3.
